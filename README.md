Spam-Image-Classification-using-Capsule-Network.
This project aims to address the limitation of traditional CNN models by leveraging the Capsule Network architecture. The model is constructed using primary capsules and incorporates a pre-trained ResNet50 as a feature extractor. Training and evaluation are conducted using a Kaggle dataset, and the model's performance is evaluated using metrics including F1 score, accuracy, precision, and recall. The objective is to enhance spam image classification by introducing a novel approach that surpasses the constraints of conventional CNN based methodologies.
